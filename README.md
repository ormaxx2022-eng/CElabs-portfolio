# Web3 Systems & Protocol Architecture Portfolio

Clean-room portfolio of system design artifacts: specs, diagrams, invariants, interfaces, and architecture samples.
No proprietary code. No client IP. Focus on long-lived protocol and data infrastructure design.

## Competency Domains (5 pillars)

1) On-chain Data & Indexing Architecture  
- indexers, observers, ETL/ELT, schemas, integrity guard rails  
→ Repo: (link)

2) Smart Contract & Protocol Architecture  
- modular contract systems, upgradeability models, invariants, failure modes  
→ Repo: (link)

3) Mempool / MEV-aware Systems (surface-level)  
- transaction lifecycle, propagation, public/private mempools, ordering constraints  
→ Repo: (link)

4) L1/L2 Infrastructure Architecture  
- rollup pipelines, sequencer flows, DA concepts, bridge patterns, observability  
→ Repo: (link)

5) Tokenomics Architecture  
- emission schedules, vesting/locking modules, incentive mechanisms, governance models  
→ Repo: (link)

## Architectural Foundations
- Architectural Responsibility & Ownership Boundaries
- Why systems fail without ownership zones
- Invariants & guard rails as a stability layer

## Outputs I deliver
- architecture specs (PDF/MD)
- component diagrams (Mermaid / draw.io)
- interface contracts and state-transition models
- integration blueprints
- risk/failure-mode analysis (system-level)
