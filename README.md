# CElabs Portfolio

This repository contains a clean-room architecture portfolio
and experimental protocol implementations.

## Architecture documentation

The architectural framework, design principles, and system models
are documented in the `/docs` directory.

👉 **Start here:** [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md)

## Repository structure (high level)

- `/docs` — architecture thinking, models, and design principles
- `/specs` — protocol specifications and invariants
- `/contracts` — implementation layer (if present)
- `/audits` — security reviews and notes

## Notes

This repository is not intended as a product showcase or
production-ready implementation.
