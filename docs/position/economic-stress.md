# Economic Stress

In ecosystem-scale systems, economic forces do not exist
outside the architecture.
They shape behavior, incentives, and system load in ways
that cannot be treated as external factors.

This document outlines how economic stress manifests
as a system-level phenomenon and why architectural thinking
must explicitly account for it.

## What is economic stress in system terms

Within this portfolio, economic stress is defined as any condition where:

- participant behavior becomes asymmetrical
- incentives drift away from intended system roles
- system usage concentrates unevenly
- cost structures distort expected interactions

Economic stress is not about market outcomes.
It is about how system behavior changes under incentive pressure.

## Why purely technical architectures fail

Architectures that ignore economic constraints often assume:

- honest or uniform participation
- stable usage patterns
- aligned incentives across roles
- cost structures that do not affect behavior

Under economic stress, these assumptions break down,
leading to emergent behavior the system was not designed for.

## Architectural interpretation of incentives

From an architectural perspective:

- incentives define behavior envelopes
- costs act as natural rate limiters
- rewards shape role participation boundaries
- asymmetries amplify under stress

Incentives are treated as **control surfaces**,
not optimization targets.

---

## Common failure patterns

When economic stress is not accounted for, systems exhibit:

- incentive inversion (undesired actions become viable)
- role overload or role abandonment
- concentration of activity in narrow system paths
- governance mechanisms overwhelmed by economic pressure

These are architectural failures, not economic anomalies.

---

## Bounding economic behavior

Architecture addresses economic stress by:

- bounding worst-case behavior rather than optimizing averages
- limiting incentive surfaces through guard rails
- enforcing role separation despite incentive pressure
- aligning governance timing with economic dynamics

The goal is not to eliminate economic stress,
but to prevent it from destabilizing the system.

## Implications for architecture models

All architecture models in this repository:

- treat incentives as part of system design
- consider economic stress as a primary stressor
- define invariants that limit incentive-driven behavior
- avoid assumptions of rational or cooperative participation

Economic behavior is a property of the system,
not an external variable.
